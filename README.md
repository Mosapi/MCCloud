# MCCloud
This is my personal project of musical space. It is very similar to soundcloud don't look so surprised this is. 
In the beginning, there was an idea if I could do it, and then it was time for a long time to work. In the end 
there was this project.

Hot use:

1. Install Nginx web server(php7, msql)
2. In settins folder get sql file and create db
3. You will also find settings for the Nginx server in the subfolder
4. In msql create user - login=user, pass=Take the password from the gen0.php file in the func folder

You must enable short_open_tag = On and report_errors = Off in php.ini
